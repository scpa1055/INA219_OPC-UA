# INA219_OPC-UA
This is a selfmade IoT-Project with the INA219 Current Sensor. I have used this Sensor to overwatch a industry plant made with LEGO Mindstorms. I have used the offical Node-OPCUA Stack and the INA219 Node package. I also added some visualisations to the given Data with RGraph via SockJS.
